# Dart Program for String Manipulation, Collections, File Handling, and Date/Time Operations

## Overview

This Dart program demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. **String Manipulation**: Includes string concatenation, interpolation, substring extraction, case conversion, string reversal, and length calculation.
2. **Collections**: Showcases the use of lists, sets, and maps with operations like adding, removing, and iterating over items.
3. **File Handling**: Reads from an input file and writes new data to an output file. Includes error handling for file operations.
4. **Date and Time Operations**: Uses Dart's `DateTime` class to format, parse, manipulate dates, and calculate the difference between two dates.

## Files

- `main.dart`: Contains the main Dart program implementing the above functionalities.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK: Ensure that Dart SDK is installed on your machine. [Installation Instructions](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the File**

   Save the provided Dart code into a file named `main.dart`.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.dart` is saved.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
Run the Program

Use the following command to run the Dart program:

dart run main.dart

For Dart 2.10 or earlier, you might need to use:

dart main.dart

## File Handling

Ensure that you have an input.txt file in the same directory as main.dart for the file handling part of the program.
The program will create and write data to output.txt in the same directory.

## Program Functions
**String Manipulation**: Demonstrates basic operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, case conversion, and string reversal.
**Collections**: Examples of list, set, and map operations, along with appropriate use cases.
**File Handling**: Reads from input.txt and writes to output.txt, with error handling for file operations.
**Date and Time Operations**: Formats, parses, and manipulates dates, and calculates the difference between two dates.

## Contributing
Feel free to modify and extend the code as needed. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
